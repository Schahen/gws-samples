        Well, it's more likely it's enough to change only styling but
        you can change view - that said, you can have different DOM tree.
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>This is completely a different layout!</td>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <b ui:field="text"></b>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</ui:UiBinder>
